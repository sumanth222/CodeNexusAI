            Starting something new, may seem simple but is a very bold move one can make.
            Leaving the thing one always does and doing something new takes a lot of courage.<br/>
            Just like how I have started this, there are a lot of things that could happen.<br/>
            There is a chance that no one could ever use this, me and my couple of friends could be the only ones who use this.
            All the time resources I had spent on this could entirely go to waste.<br/><br/>
            But that is not the point of this.<br/>
            By deciding to start something new itself, you are doing something that most of the people are afraid to do.<br/>
            But deciding itself is not enough, hanging on to an idea even if is big or small, going through with it, no matter what, is the important step.<br/>
            No matter if you win or lose, if you decide to do something new and actually accomplish it you have already won!<br/><br/>
            Thanks for reading!
